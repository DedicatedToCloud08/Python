# Day 1 Python Project

This is my Day 1 project for my Cloud/DevOps learning path.

## Description
A simple Python script (`hello.py`) that:
- Prompts the user for their name
- Greets the user with a formatted message using f-strings
- Demonstrates basic Python concepts like functions, input/output, and type hints

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/DedicatedToCloud08/Python.git
   cd Python


## Day 2 â€“ Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operations

- Learned about Python data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Practiced arithmetic, string manipulation, and boolean logic
- Wrote a script (`day2_variables.py`) that builds a profile summary using inputs
